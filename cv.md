## About Me
Passionate about AI, machine learning, and building reliable data systems.

## Experience
- **Principal Data Scientist** @ Dun & Bradstreet (2021–Present)
  - Developed product-based customer attrition and retention machine learning models using a wide variety of usage, web-traffic, sentiment, sales, and firmographic data. Created insights and recommendations to operations, marketing, and sales teams for determining triggers to reduce customer churn.
  - Developed 50+ propensity models to determine new prospects by building look-alike machine learning models, impacting over $100M USD in sales and retention.
  - Overhauled data engineering processes to facilitate automated data refreshes for RevUp ABX targeting, segmentation, and ML platform.
  - Lead automation efforts for the Commercial Ops team for targeting using Marketo.
  - Implemented the modernization of the data architecture of the Marketing back-end systems for improving efficiency of campaigns and growing the franchise.
  - Created POCs for implementing Generative AI usecases in the Marketing org.
  - Lead D&B’s Womens Employee Resource Group and their mentorship program.
  - Won B2B Innovator Vanguard Award at B2BSMX for generating sales for D&B while breaking new ground for women to advance their careers and roles.
  - Won two Ultimate DUNS awards for developing high performance ML models.
 
- **Senior Data Scientist** @ FedEx Corporation (2015–2021)
  - As the head data scientist, lead the analysis, reporting, and machine learning effort to optimize the performance of SenseAware IoT system which consists of millions of sensor devices generating gigabytes of real-time data per hour.
  - Worked closely with marketing, product, operations, end-users, and hardware design teams to optimize the performance of various FedEx systems using advanced analytics.
  - Performed statistical analysis and developed custom event detection systems using Python and R, followed by graphical representation, and visualization of the characteristics of data using Tableau.
  - Developed test procedures, lead testing and data analysis to recommend improvements for access points, van GPS devices, and other enhancements to IoT devices in the SenseAware ecosystem.
  - Developed innovation concepts where a broad range of skills are required including but not limited to robotics, machine vision, virtual and augmented reality and demonstrated the potential use of these technologies at FedEx.
  - Received four BZ awards and an IT Hall of Fame team award.
 
- **Principal Data Scientist** @ Nextech Solutions LLC - for FedEx Corporation (2014–2015)
  - Developed algorithms for data processing, designed flowcharts and pseudocodes for software and firmware development for SenseAware IoT.
  - Utilized machine learning techniques to determine the best profiles for hardware devices under various environments, optimizing the capture percentage, RSSI quality, reconfiguration time, and battery usage.
  - Designed the message formats for communication, profiles for sensor devices and the data simplification model. Developed custom edge computing techniques to simplify and aggregate the data into 0.25% of its original volume without compromising the quality.
 
- **Graduate Research Assistant** @ Data Mining Research Laboratory - Louisiana Tech University (2011–2014)
  - Authored Computer Science thesis titled- “Development of a clique-based dimensionality reduction technique and its application to gene expression.” where I developed a network-graph-based algorithm to find genes that may play a key role in Alzheimer’s disease and provided input to the biologists for looking at pathways where the predicted genes were highly expressed.
  - Authored Biomedical Engineering practicum titled - “Developing a Machine Learning Model for Patients having high risk of Heart Diseases.”
  - Built an autonomous AWS based application for analyzing patient data.
  - Mentored university students and organized robotics competitions.
 
- **Graduate Researcher** @ School of Public Health - Louisiana State University (2012)
  - Selected competitively among graduate students for Louisiana Biomedical Summer Research program to perform computational analysis on Stomach Cancer gene expression and public health data.
  - Successfully performed analysis on genomic data for biologists using feature selection and machine learning based ranking algorithms.
